Location: Milan

I will be presenting [[thermonerf]]--our novel multimodal approach based on Neural Radiance Fields, capable of rendering new RGB and thermal views of a scene jointly–at the workshop on Neural Fields Beyond Conventional Cameras at ECCV 2024.

Come talk to me!

The code to our method can be found on [github](https://github.com/Schindler-EPFL-Lab/thermo-nerf) and the preprint is available on [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/html/2403.12154v1).
