# Insulated: Integrated solution for lean and abridged thermal evaluation with digital twins

**Event**: [Intelligent Maintenance Conference](https://smartmaintenance.ch/archive/2023/index.html)

**Location**: EPFL - Lausanne - Switzerland

## Abstract

In 2016, the European Commission presented data showing that buildings account for 40% of energy consumption and 36% of CO2 emissions in the EU. Investments in a clean energy building stock can drive the transition to a low-carbon economy and place cities at the forefront of the climate change agenda. However, while buildings are regularly maintained or improved, energy-saving investments are often not prioritized due to a lack of trustworthy information, skilled workers, or doubts about the possible benefits. In this talk, we will first discuss how energy renovations—and their benefits—are currently decided and evaluated. We will shed some light on existing difficulties and possible avenues for innovations/improvements—with a focus on digital twins, 3D models, semantic segmentation, and machine learning for retrofit solutions. We conclude the talk with our vision for the future of building renovation and maintenance; we believe it to be data-driven, smart, and in control of the citizens.
